Hi, I'm Yihwan 👋

I'm a developer from San Francisco. Like much of the world, I was taken 
aback by how quickly countries were shutting down borders and restricting 
travel in response to COVID-19. Since things are changing so quickly, 
I created this site to keep track of the latest travel restrictions.

I've sourced these updates from various news outlets, leaning most heavily on 
<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/03/coronavirus-travel-restrictions-border-shutdowns-country-200318091505922.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Al Jazeera</a>, 
<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/coronavirus-travel-restrictions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>, 
and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2020/mar/23/coronavirus-travel-updates-which-countries-have-restrictions-and-fco-warnings-in-place" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>. But since the situation on the ground is evolving so rapidly, I invite you to share what you're experiencing at ports of entry
around the world using <a href="https://forms.gle/Z9giq891zqekY43J8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this form</a>. 

Please understand that while I do my best to keep this site reliably updated, 
I can't guarantee to the accuracy or recency of any available information. 
You can read the full Terms of Use of this site here. 

I know these are scary times, but I also know that we'll make it through this. 
Let's be kind to one another, and remember to wash 🧼 your 👏 hands ✨!

These countries are currently not shown due to invalid an invalid ISO A3 ("-99") code from the `react-simple-maps` source URL: 
* Northern Cyprus 
* Kosovo

Puerto Rico was considered part of the United States. Antartica was taken out because it made the map look bad. Sorry Antarctica!
